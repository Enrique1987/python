    "\n",
    "`Extraction-based:`  Uses various weighting functions to rank sentences by perceveived importance. Words uses more often are considered more important. Consequently, sentences containing those words are considred more important. The overall behavior is like using a yellow highligther to manually select keywords and sentences without altering the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique is good at pulling out important words and phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Abstraction:` Deeper compehension of the document to capture intent and produce more humal-like paraphasing. This includes creating completly new sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction algorithms requred advanced and complicated deep learning methods and sophisticated language modeling."
